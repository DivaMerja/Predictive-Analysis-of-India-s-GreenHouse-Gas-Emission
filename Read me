# 🇮🇳 Greenhouse Gas Emission Prediction – India (1990–2050)

This project uses machine learning techniques (Dense Neural Networks and LSTM) to predict India’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sector-wise (Energy, Agriculture, Industry) and gas-wise (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O) from historical data (1990–2021), and forecasts until 2050.

## 📊 Objective

To analyze trends, identify key emission drivers, and build predictive models that can aid policymakers in designing effective climate mitigation strategies aligned with SDG 13: Climate Action.

## 🧠 Methods Used

- **Dense Neural Networks (DNN)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
- Time-series forecasting
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Evaluation metrics: MSE, RMSE
