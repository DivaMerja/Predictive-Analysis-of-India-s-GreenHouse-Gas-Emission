# 🇮🇳 Greenhouse Gas Emission Prediction – India (1990–2050)

This project uses machine learning techniques (Dense Neural Networks and LSTM) to predict India’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sector-wise (Energy, Agriculture, Industry) and gas-wise (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O) from historical data (1990–2021), and forecasts until 2050.

## Objective

To analyze trends, identify key emission drivers, and build predictive models that can aid policymakers in designing effective climate mitigation strategies aligned with SDG 13: Climate Action.

## Methods Used

- **Dense Neural Networks (DNN)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
- Time-series forecasting
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Evaluation metrics: MSE, RMSE

## Files

- `greenhouse-gas-emission-prediction-india.ipynb` – Main notebook with data analysis, model training, and forecasting.
- `historical_emissions.zip` – Dataset (contains emissions data from multiple sources).
- `Report.pdf` – Case study project report.

## Outputs
Visualizations of historical GHG trends

Model comparison (DNN vs LSTM)

Forecasted GHG emissions up to 2050

Sector-specific insights (e.g., energy, agriculture)

## Forecast Highlights
Energy is the leading contributor to India's emissions.

LSTM outperformed DNN in forecasting accuracy.

Emissions are projected to rise unless mitigation strategies are implemented.
